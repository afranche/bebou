Single Page app to help breathing exercises. It's made as I could
not find the previous utility I used to calm myself during panic
attacks and thus decided to make one myself and share it for others
in need. I do not claim to be a doctor or anything but it does help
me !

The app only works on mobile for now. The UI is kinda trimmed since
I have zero knowledge on svg !

## TODO List

- [x] Breathing timer
- [ ] i18n (Available in French only atm)
- [ ] Ability to play Brown noise to allow for a better calm
- [ ] FAQ section, and About sections
- [ ] Enhanced animation

## Contributing

The code is currently ugly. I'll clean it a bit and draw out a real contributing guide then.
